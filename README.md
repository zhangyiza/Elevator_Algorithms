# Elevator_Algorithms
Simulate seven elevator algorithms with minimized waiting time strategy and different stop strategies.
## Project Goals
The goal is to improve the algorithm of the two elevators of a building in Tsinghua university by minimizing the waiting time of the users.
## Method
- Data is collected during the noon rush hours to estimate arrival distribution, starting state probability vector and transition probability matrix.
- Data quality is checked and sample independence is tested.
- Seven algorithms are designed, implemented, simulated and visualized for the 2-elevator system based on minimized waiting time strategy and different stop strategies(base station settings).The simulation software is `PlantSimulation`
- A simulation experiment is conducted to compare the algorithms 
- Output like the average waiting time and average energy consumption(Travel distance/Total flow) is analyzed
